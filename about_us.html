      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>PROcrastination was founded in 2023 by our team, who struggled with procrastination throughout our lives.
         After learning about the science behind procrastination and finding strategies that helped us overcome it,
          we decided to create a platform to share our knowledge and help others.</p>
          
      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>At PROcrastination, we believe that overcoming procrastination requires both a practical and a mindset shift. 
        We provide practical tips and tools to help people take action towards their goals, as well as resources to 
        help shift their mindset and break the cycle of procrastination.</p>
