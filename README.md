## Site structure

Our site includes four main pages: "About Us", "Articles", "Contacts", and "FAQ". We also created 3 articles that can be accessed via the "Contacts" page. Some of the articles are interconnected, that is one referring to another using a link. This structure is simple and intuitive, hence we selected it.

## Design

We wanted the site to be in light colors not toxic with good contrasts, so we selected lilac(#C8A2C8), bright grey(#F8F8F8), denim(#6F8FAF), and white(#FFFFFF). The overall layout of the site is simple as well: one paragraph goes after another. This structure is appropriate for a blog, which is the type of our site. We use the Serif family of fonts in the site because it fits the aesthetic design of the site.

## File structure

The main four pages are represented by the main 4 HTML files which are stored directly in the root directory. Each article is represented by its own HTML file. These files for articles are stored in a separate folder "articles". All the images used on the site are stored in a separate folder "images". There is only one CSS file that defines styles for all the pages, it is as well stored in a separate folder called "css". The file you are reading right now is "README.md" which is stored in the root directory.

## HTML implementation

We used classical semantic elements such as main, nav, or header as well as <div>, <p>, and <h_> tags. We assigned classes or ids to them and included CSS files to all the HTML files to style the elements. The layout was mostly done using margin and padding CSS properties. The site works as it was supposed to work without any unexpected bugs.
