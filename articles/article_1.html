        <h3>Are you a procrastinator?</h3>    
        <p>No matter how well-organized and committed you are, chances are that you have found yourself frittering 
            away hours on trivial pursuits (watching TV, updating your Facebook status, shopping online) when you 
            should have been spending that time on work or school-related projects.

            Whether you're putting off finishing a project for work, avoiding homework assignments, or ignoring 
            household chores, procrastination can have a major impact on your job, your grades, and your life.</p>

            <h2>What is procrastination?</h2>
                <p>Procrastination is the act of delaying or putting off tasks until the last minute or past their deadline. Some researchers define procrastination as a "form of self-regulation failure characterized by the irrational delay of tasks despite potentially negative consequences.</p>
            
            
      
            <h3>Causes</h3>
            <p>Remember that time that you thought you had a week left to finish a project that was really due the next day?
                 How about the time you decided not to clean up your apartment because you "didn't feel like doing it right now?"</p><br>

              <p>We often assume that projects won't take as long to finish as they really will, which can lead to a false 
                sense of security when we believe that we still have plenty of time to complete these tasks.3</p><br>
                
               <p>One of the biggest factors contributing to procrastination is the notion that we have to feel inspired or
                 motivated to work on a task at a particular moment.</p><br>
                
                <div class="causes">
                    <p>The reality is that if you wait until you're in the right frame of mind to do certain tasks (especially undesirable ones), 
                        you will probably find that the right time simply never comes along and the task never gets completed.</p>

                </div>

                <p>The following are a few other factors that cause procrastination.</p>

                <img src="../images/cycle.png" alt="Picture of the cycle of procrastination.">

                <h3>Academics</h3>
                <p>Researchers suggest that procrastination can be <u>particularly</u> pronounced among students. 
                    A 2007 meta analysis published in the Psychological Bulletin found that a whopping <b>80%</b> to 
                    <b>95%</b> of college students procrastinated on a regular basis, particularly when it came to completing
                     assignments and coursework.


                    According to researchers, there are some major cognitive distortions that lead to academic procrastination.
                     Students tend to:</p>

                     <ol class="academics">
                        <li>Overestimate how much time they have left to perform tasks</li>
                        <li>Overestimate how motivated they will be in the future</li>
                        <li>Underestimate how long certain activities will take to complete</li>
                        <li>Mistakenly assume that they need to be in the right frame of mind to work on a project</li>
                     </ol>

                <h3>Depression</h3>
                <p>Procrastination can also be a result of <u>depression</u>. Feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and a 
                    lack of energy can make it difficult to start (and finish) the simplest task. Depression can also 
                    lead to self-doubt. When you can't figure out how to tackle a project or feel insecure about your abilities,
                     you might find it easier to put it off.</p>

                <h3>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</h3>
                <p>Procrastination is also pretty common in people with <u>obsessive-compulsive disorder</u>. One reason is that OCD is often 
                    linked with maladaptive perfectionism, which causes fears about making new mistakes, doubts about whether you 
                    are doing something correctly, and worry over others' expectations of you.<br><br>

                    People with OCD also often have a propensity toward indecision, causing them to procrastinate rather than make a 
                    decision.</p>
                <h3>Present Bias</h3>
                <p>The <u>present bias</u> is a phenomenon observed in human behavior that may result in procrastination. The present bias
                     means that we tend to be motivated more by immediate gratification or rewards than we are by long-term rewards.<br><br> This is why it feels good in the moment to procrastinate.3


                     This is why it feels good at the moment to procrastinate.3 This is why it feels good at the moment to procrastinate.3 For example, the immediate reward of staying in bed and watching TV is more appealing than the long-term reward of publishing a blog post, which would take much longer to accomplish.</p>
                <h3>How to get rid of it?</h3>
