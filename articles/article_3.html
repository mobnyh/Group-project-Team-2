        <h2>How to Know You're a Procrastinator</h2>
        <article>
          <p>Are you always putting off tasks until the last minute? Do you find
            yourself distracted by social media or other activities instead of
            focusing on what you need to do? If so, you might be a
            procrastinator!</p>
          <p>Here are some telltale signs that you're a procrastinator:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You always wait until the night before a deadline to start
              working on a project.</li>
            <li>You spend more time making to-do lists than actually completing
              tasks on them.</li>
            <li>You constantly check your phone or social media instead of
              focusing on work.</li>
            <li>You feel like you work best under pressure, even though it
              causes you a lot of stress.</li>
            <li>You find yourself cleaning your entire house instead of starting
              on a big project.</li>
            <li>You've been meaning to start a new hobby for months, but never
              actually get around to it.</li>
          </ul>
