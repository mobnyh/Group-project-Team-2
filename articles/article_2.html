      <h2>How to fight procrastination</h2>
      <p>The pile of your undone tasks becomes higher than Everest? Is the famous phrase of Scarlett O'Hara I'll think about it tomorrow your new credo? Well, highly likely you're sinking into procrastination. Don't worry in this article you'll figure out how to tackle it.</p>
      
        <section>
            <h3>In a nutshell, what is procrastination?</h3>
            <p>We have already posted an article discussing what procrastination is. If you have not read it, we strongly recommend doing it:</p>
                <div class="suggest">
                    <h4><a href="article_1.html">What is procrastination?</a></h4><br>
                    <p>A short description of the article will be located here when the article is created.</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                  However, if you did not read it, in a nutshell, procrastination is constantly delaying tasks you must do. Why do we postpone tasks we know we have to do? Psychologists have an opinion that procrastination is a form of stress relief. When you have some stressful event, situation, or anything that makes you stressed out like financial problems, health issues, or even any minor difficulties which everyone has, your brain refuses to work. When you try to make effort to force yourself to start doing the task, the brain tells you "I will not do this. I already have a thing to stress out about, and now you want to give me even more?" And here procrastination begins.</p>
          
            <h3>How to get rid of it?</h3>
            <p>We found an awesome technique to tackle it. Procrastination is considered to be a habit. Every habit has a trigger, a pattern you repeat, and a reward. In the case of procrastination that is correspondingly stress, avoidance of work, and a little stress relief. Unfortunately, in the vast majority of cases, it is impossible to eliminate stress absolutely, nevertheless, you are able to modify the pattern (avoiding work) and fight procrastination. 
            </p>
      
            <h3>What's the plan?</h3>
            <p>To change the pattern of work avoidance we have a simple and efficient plan for you.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Acknowledge the stress.</b> Next time you feel uneasy to begin your work, you spend too much time doing things you should not realize it. Tell yourself "Stop, probably I am experiencing stress".</li>
                    <li><b>5,4,3,2,1.</b> Cout down from 5 to 1 to break down the habit.</li>
                    <li><b>Do 1 thing.</b> It can be anything. Start working for 5 minutes only. You simply need to start doing anything related to your tasks. The issue with procrastination is not that you don't work, it is that you cannot start. 80% of people who started working in this situation will keep going. You just need to begin.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Definitely try it out in practice and win procrastination!<br><br>
